      <description>Recently, at work, we were debugging an issue where dl_close was not unloading the library . You might wonder why that even matters - if your library contains any global symbols, then their state will persist across a dl_open, dl_close sequence. In other words, your library isn&amp;rsquo;t starting from a clean state every time.&#xA;In the case we were debugging, this issue manifested in the following fashion: We had two libraries libA and libB and libA dynamically depends on libB.</description>

      <description>I’m Kishore Ganesh. I love everything about Computer Science, from nifty discrete math proofs to more concrete systems-domains like Operating System to visual domains like Computer Graphics. I love building projects, especially in domains I’m unfamiliar with.&#xA;One of my favorite things to do is to dive into a new topic and spend multiple weeks building up expertise on it.&#xA;My most notable projects are:&#xA;Jack Toolchain: Wishing to know how computers work on a low level, I followed the NAND2Tetris book and built a computer from scratch in a hardware simulator, along with a two-phase compiler and assembler for the same computer.</description>

      <title>Writing a simple JSON Parser from scratch in C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>JSON is one of the most common data interchange formats there is. Thankfully, it is also a pretty simple one. I had written a JSON parser in C++ sometime back, and whilst making it I came across a few decisions that were more involved than I thought they would be. So I have decided to write an article around that JSON Parser. While JSON Parsing is simple, writing one would definitely be useful to build more complex parsers, since the general principles are still present.</description>

      <title>Taking away control: The dumb programmer and the smart compiler</title>

      <description>Good compilers prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. Today, you have a wide assortment of programming languages to choose from, you can have your pick of paradigm. As a brief detour, the perspective of programmers comes full circle as they move from beginner to slightly experienced to intermediate.&#xA;The beginner is deathly afraid of the differences between programming languages. In the beginning, they stick to one language out of the fear of learning something new.</description>

      <description>A long, long time back, in a galaxy far far away, I was doing the same thing I’m doing right now. Booting up a blog. Genesis. Creation. My older blogs are many years behind me, and now a new journey begins.&#xA;I have witnessed a stark change in how I view blogging, or how I view writing in general over my 4 years of college. More on that in a later post, but I’m excited to embark on this new journey, incorporating the many insights hidden away in some deep dark corner of my Google Keep.</description>
